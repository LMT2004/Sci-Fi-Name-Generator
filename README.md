Science Fiction name generator. Uses various parts of names, like "li" or "toz" and combines them in such a way to make authentic-sounding science fiction names, inspired by Star Wars.
Sometimes they have a last name, sometimes they don't.
Sometimes they have a title, like "Captain" or "Princess" instead of a first name.
Sometimes the name includes a "-" between parts to be more realistic.
